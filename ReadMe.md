# **SALU – AI-Augmented Digital Assistant for Rural Healthcare**  

## **Overview**  
Healthcare in rural areas of middle- and low-income countries faces critical challenges, including doctor shortages, insufficient medical explanations, limited health literacy, and language barriers. Many patients struggle to access proper healthcare guidance, while individual doctors often lack digital platforms for outreach.  

To address these issues, I am developing **SALU**, an AI-powered digital assistant designed to provide **reliable medical information, test report analysis, and post-treatment guidance** in regional languages.  

## **Technology Stack**  
- **Frontend**: React Native Expo  
- **Backend**: Flask, Rasa  
- **AI/ML**: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning  

## **Features**  
✅ Medical information before/after examinations  
✅ Disease and test report analysis  
✅ Nutrition & dietary guidance  
✅ Regional language support  
✅ AI-driven conversational assistant  

## **Motivation**  
Despite rapid advancements in AI, IoT, and digital assistants, rural healthcare remains underserved. **SALU** bridges this gap by leveraging cutting-edge AI to enhance accessibility, understanding, and engagement with healthcare services.
